This workspace contains a minimal landing page scaffold using Express, Tailwind (via CDN), and Three.js. It renders an animated eyeglasses scene you can customize and swap your logo.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd /workspaces/kuyabloom
npm install
```

2. Run the server:

```bash
npm start
```

3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Notes

-   Tailwind is included via CDN in `public/index.html` for simplicity. For production, consider adding a build step and using the Tailwind CLI/PostCSS pipeline.
-   Replace `public/assets/logo.svg` and `public/assets/icon.svg` with your own assets.
-   `public/js/glasses.js` contains the Three.js scene for the eyeglasses animation — edit parameters to change materials, colors, or geometry.
